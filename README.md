# Electronic Customer Service Representative
The Electronic Customer Service Representative (ECSR) is an ad hoc incident management / change management / configuration management database / problem management / service request (SR) management system (whew!). The goal is to provide an application that is intuitive enough to understand:
- when an incident / SR is entered, include:
	* where the configuration item (CI) is located in the enterprise
	* who the owners are of the CI
	* what is the appropriate support team
	* other affected CI
- if there is a problem, and is so, enter a problem ticket, and include:
	* where the configuration item (CI) is located in the enterprise
	* who the owners are of the CI
	* what is the appropriate support team
	* other affected CI
- include in the taxonomy classification for an incident / SR: 
	* where the configuration item (CI) is located in the enterprise
	* who the owners are of the CI
	* what is the appropriate support team
	* other affected CI
	* allow for "tribal" / tacit classifications ("the ACME document site" becomes the Microsoft Share Point site for ACME documentation, hosted on server XYZ, etc.)

As of this writing, it is still a work in progress and under constant modification.
